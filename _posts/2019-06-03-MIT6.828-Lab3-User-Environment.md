## 一、Introduction

___

In this lab you will implement the basic kernel facilities required to get a protected user-mode environment (i.e., "process") running. You will enhance the JOS kernel to set up the data structures to keep track of user environments, create a single user environment, load a program image into it, and start it running. You will also make the JOS kernel capable of handling any system calls the user environment makes and handling any other exceptions it causes.

Note: In this lab, the terms environment and process are interchangeable - both refer to an abstraction that allows you to run a program. We introduce the term "environment" instead of the traditional term "process" in order to stress the point that JOS environments and UNIX processes provide different interfaces, and do not provide the same semantics.
