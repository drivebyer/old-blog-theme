clients send RPCs to **k/v layer** in leader

**k/v layer** forwards request to **Raft layer**, doesn't respond to client yet

servers apply operation to **k/v state machine** once leader says it's committed

leader responds to **k/v layer** after it has committed

**k/v layer** applies Put to DB, or fetches Get result

then leader replies to client w/ execution result


the service keeps the **state machine** state, e.g. **key/value DB**
